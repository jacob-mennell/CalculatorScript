# Calculator Script

Function loads instructions from input.txt file and returns an output number to the screen. Instructions comprise a lower case keyword and a number that are separated by a space per line.
Instructions: 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'apply' The last instruction should be "apply" and a number (e.g., "apply 3"). The calculator is then initialised with that number and the previous instructions are applied to that number.

    Example:
    [Input from file]
    add 2
    multiply 3
    apply
    [Output to screen]
    15

    :return: float
